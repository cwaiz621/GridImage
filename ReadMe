Completed Advanced Stories:
Advanced: Robust error handling, check if internet is available, handle error cases, network failures
Advanced: Use the ActionBar SearchView or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
Advanced: User can share an image to their friends or email it to themselves


Notes: 
For some reason, when I use the emulator, when I first submit the search, the first JSONArray loads twice
This doesn not happen when I use my phone as the emulator though
